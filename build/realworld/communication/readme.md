XInput controller
	The usage of an XInput controller (e.g. XBox 360 controller) requires DirectX, which is only available on Windows. The necessary software will automatically be installed by Windows 10 when connecting the controller to the machine. With earlier versions of Windows, DirectX might have to be downloaded manually. Download the version that is appropriate for your version of Windows. The library reading the input also requires the software "Pyglet". Command line code to install it can be found in the "install" file.
