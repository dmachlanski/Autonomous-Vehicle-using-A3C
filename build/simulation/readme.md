# How to use the simulator

Firstly use the install instructions in the install file to correctly install the program. 

The program is divided into two seperate programs. A server and a simulator.

## Server

To start a server, open a Terminal window and use

```shell
cd ~/tesla
python3 A3C-classification.py
```

This will now wait for the simulator to start

## Simulator

To start the simulator, open a new Terminal window and use

```shell
torcs
```

Start a race in Quickrace mode. 

The server and client will now connect and the training process has started
